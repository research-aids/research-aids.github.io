Objects from Aruba, Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao held in Dutch museum collections are often not attributed to specific islands. It is therefore important to use multiple search terms referring to the islands in the Caribbean region formerly colonised by the Netherlands.",

        "content": "### Description\n\nAruba, Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao (the ABC islands, also known as the Leeward Islands from a colonial perspective) are three island territories in the Caribbean Sea, just off the coast of Venezuela. The indigenous Caquet\u00edo people spoke an Arawak language and probably settled the islands from the Paraguan\u00e1 Peninsula in Venezuela. The Spanish conquistador Alonso de Ojeda visited the archipelago in 1499, ushering in a long period of European colonial rule. In 1634, the [Dutch West India Company](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q617066) conquered the island of Cura\u00e7ao from the small Spanish occupying force and developed the island, with its strategically located Sint Anna Bay, into a stronghold in the war between the Dutch Republic and Spain. Two years later, Aruba and Bonaire were also occupied from Cura\u00e7ao. After peace with Spain in 1648, Willemstad, the capital of Cura\u00e7ao, grew into a freeport, from where many slaves were traded with the Spanish colonies in the Americas.\n\nThe West India Company went bankrupt in 1791 and Cura\u00e7ao was twice occupied by the British during the Napoleonic Wars. The [Treaty of London of 1814](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q617263) of 1814 placed the islands under the authority of the newly founded Kingdom of the Netherlands, which merged them administratively with Sint Eustatius and Dependencies and Suriname in 1828. The merger was partially reversed in 1845, after which Saba, Sint Eustatius and Sint Maarten were administered from Cura\u00e7ao. The colony was renamed the Netherlands Antilles in 1948. Together with the Netherlands and Suriname it accepted the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1954, thereby completing the decolonisation of the Dutch colonies in the Caribbean. In 1986 Aruba became a separate country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, a path followed by Cura\u00e7ao in 2010. In that year, Bonaire became a \u2018public entity\u2019 of the Netherlands. This rather complicated administrative history has had an impact on the formation of archives and collections. Please take this into account in your research.\n\nThe period of Dutch colonial rule in Aruba, Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao is in part characterised by a history of slavery and the slave trade. The [Caquet\u00edo](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5037181 people of Aruba, Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao had already been forced into labour during Spanish rule. Under Dutch rule, especially after the granting of the so-called _[Asiento de Negros](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q21099469)_ in 1671, enslaved people from West Africa were shipped to Willemstad and traded with Spanish America or forced into labour on the islands. The National Archives in The Hague has an extensive [research aid](https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/onderzoeken/zoekhulpen/korsou-curacao-mensen-van-toen) on its website that can help you research the history of slavery in Aruba, Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao. During the colonial period the Caribbean islands under Dutch colonial rule were called Cura\u00e7ao en Onderhorigheden (Cura\u00e7ao and Dependencies). As a result much archival material appears to relate only to Cura\u00e7ao despite also containing information about the other islands formerly colonised by the Netherlands. Whilst the research aid provided by the National Archives in The Hague appears to be focused on Cura\u00e7ao it also refers to archives that contain information about the other islands. There is also a research aid on [Non-commissioned officers and soldiers in the army in the West Indies 1815-1950](https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/onderzoeken/zoekhulpen/militairen-onderofficieren-en-soldaten-bij-het-leger-in-west-indie-1815-1950) that refers to relevant archival material about military personnel stationed in Aruba, Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao, as well as the research aid [Civil servants in the West Indies: Suriname and the Antilles 1815-1936](https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/onderzoeken/zoekhulpen/ambtenaren-in-west-indie-suriname-en-de-antillen-1815-1936), which contains information about Dutch colonial civil servants in Suriname, Aruba, Bonaire, Cura\u00e7ao, Saba, Sint Eustatius and Sint Maarten.\n\nDuring the colonial period many objects were transported from Aruba, Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao to the European Netherlands, where they ended up in various museum collections. Searching for objects originating from Aruba, Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao can be difficult as objects can be located anywhere. When searching museum collections, it can be useful to use multiple search terms to find objects originating from Aruba, Bonaire or Cura\u00e7ao. This is because an object may be attributed to a specific island in one case and to for example the Netherlands Antilles in another.\n\nThe Wereldmuseum, which manages a large collection of objects from Aruba, Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao, has divided its collection by region of origin. The \u2018Caribbean\u2019 category contains around 4,500 objects, but not all of these originate from Aruba, Bonaire or Cura\u00e7ao; the selection also includes objects from Jamaica and Haiti, for example. For more information about researching museum collections, see the [Doing Research](https://app.colonialcollections.nl/nl/research-aids/https%3A%2F%2Fn2t%252Enet%2Fark%3A%2F27023%2Fd2741eb61e9f4b63fa0d750159b2503d) research aid. See the [Sources](https://app.colonialcollections.nl/nl/research-aids/https%3A%2F%2Fn2t%252Enet%2Fark%3A%2F27023%2F5f0031f66044adefab19b67b1344b31d)research aid for more information and tips on finding relevant sources for your research.\n\n### Provenance research\n\nBelow you will find various sources and websites for each island where you can find more information to get your research started. The Leiden University [subject guide on the Caribbean](https://www.bibliotheek.universiteitleiden.nl/subject-guides/caraiben) contains a lot of useful information regarding the university\u2019s Caribbean collection and other source locations. This list, compiled by the [KITLV](https://app.colonialcollections.nl/nl/research-aids/https%3A%2F%2Fn2t%252Enet%2Fark%3A%2F27023%2F62191a1bbed9b315db786f2037417b4f), contains various links to relevant websites (not all links are still active).\n\nThe Colonial Collections Consortium is currently conducting an audit of museum collections originating from Aruba, Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao that are held in institutions in the European Netherlands.\n\n\n**Aruba**\nIn collaboration with the [the Internet Archive](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q461) a large part of Aruba's cultural heritage has been digitised and made accessible. The collection can be accessed via both the [Internet Archive website](https://archive.org/details/aruba?tab=collection) and the [Coleccion Aruba website](https://coleccion.aw/pages/en/home-en/). The database does not only include collections located in Aruba itself but also relevant collections held for example in the [National Archives of the Netherlands](https://coleccion.aw/browse/?col=NL-HaNa-aruba) and the museums of the [Wereldmuseum](https://coleccion.aw/browse/?col=nmvw-caribischecollectie), as well as other institutions in the Netherlands. There is also a specific [slavery database](https://coleccion.aw/database/en/) where you can search for (archival) collections relating to enslaved people in Aruba in the period 1840-1863. Unlike those enslaved in Suriname, who remained under Dutch state supervision for another ten years after the abolition of slavery in 1863, those enslaved in Aruba, Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao gained their freedom immediately on 1 July 1863.\n\nOther relevant resources:\n - [Archivo Nacional Aruba](https://ana.aw/)\n - [Museo Arkeologico Nacional Aruba](https://manaruba.org/)\n - The research aid [K\u00f2rsou \u2013 Cura\u00e7ao](https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/onderzoeken/zoekhulpen/korsou-curacao-mensen-van-toen) of the National Archives of the Netherlands also contains relevant information concerning Aruba.\n - The [Delpher](https://www.delpher.nl/)includes newspapers, such as the Amigoe di Cura\u00e7ao, that contain relevant information about Aruba, Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao.\n - The book [De geschiedenis van Aruba tot 1816 : van zustereiland tot imperium in imperio](https://search.worldcat.org/title/1051752557)' by historian Adi Martis describes the precolonial history of Aruba and the period of colonial rule by the Dutch West Indian Company.\n\n**Bonaire**\nThe [Fundashon Hist\u00f3riko Kultural Boneriano](https://fuhikubo.org/foundation.php?lc=nl) (FuHiKuBo) is a central foundation in the Bonaire heritage field. Established in 1998, the foundation aims to document, collect and preserve everything related to the intangible heritage of Bonaire. This has resulted in various platforms, such as [Archivo Boneiru](http://www.archivoboneiru.com/) and [Patrimonio Kultural Intangibel Boneiru](https://www.patrimoniokulturalintangibelboneiru.com/). As described above, it is important to use multiple search terms when researching Bonaire's heritage at Dutch institutions, for example by searching on 'Cura\u00e7ao en Onderhorigheden' and not just on 'Bonaire'. This is because the islands in the Caribbean that were colonised by the Netherlands were assigned the administrative term Cura\u00e7ao en Onderhorigheden, with no distinction being made between the different islands.\n\nOther relevant resources:\n - The research aid [K\u00f2rsou \u2013 Cura\u00e7ao](https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/onderzoeken/zoekhulpen/korsou-curacao-mensen-van-toen) of the National Archives of the Netherlands also contains relevant information concerning Bonaire.\n - The [Colonial History](https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/onderzoeken/zoekhulpen/koloniale-geschiedenis) research aid of the National Archives of the Netherlands can also direct you to relevant archival material regarding Bonaire.\n - The [Delpher](https://www.delpher.nl/) collection includes newspapers, such as the Amigoe di Cura\u00e7ao, that contain relevant information regarding Aruba, Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao.\n\n**Cura\u00e7ao**\nFor a long time Cura\u00e7ao was eponymous with the Caribbean islands that were colonised by the Netherlands, which means that a relatively large amount of archive material is available about this island. The National Archives of the Netherlands' research aid [K\u00f2rsou \u2013 Cura\u00e7ao](https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/onderzoeken/zoekhulpen/korsou-curacao-mensen-van-toen) directs you to a large amount of relevant archive material about the colonial history of Cura\u00e7ao. The research aids [Cura\u00e7ao: Slave and Emancipation Registers 1839-1863](https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/onderzoeken/zoekhulpen/curacao-slaven-en-emancipatieregisters-1839-1863) and [Cura\u00e7ao: Free from Slavery (manumissions) 1722-1863](https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/onderzoeken/zoekhulpen/curacao-vrij-van-slavernij-manumissies-1722-1863) may also be relevant to research into the history of slavery on Cura\u00e7ao. \n\nThe website [Cura\u00e7ao History](https://www.curacaohistory.com/)provides a useful timeline that divides the history of the island into clear time periods, which can help you to focus your research. The [National Archives of Cura\u00e7ao](https://www.nationaalarchief.cw/collectie) has an extensive website with a wide range of information.\n\nOther relevant resources:\n - The [Delpher](https://www.delpher.nl/) collection includes newspapers, such as the Amigoe di Cura\u00e7ao, that contain relevant information regarding Aruba, Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao.\n - The [Coleccion Aruba](https://coleccion.aw/pages/en/home-en/)website, which provides online access to a large part of Aruba\u2019s cultural heritage, also contains information that is relevant to Cura\u00e7ao.\n - The research aid [Plantations and real estate in Cura\u00e7ao 1720-1845](https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/onderzoeken/zoekhulpen/plantages-en-onroerend-goed-op-curacao-1720-1845#:~:text=Plantages%20op%20Cura%C3%A7ao&text=Op%20de%20circa%20honderd%20plantages,werd%20daarnaast%20nog%20zout%20gewonnen.) of the National Archives of the Netherlands.\n",
