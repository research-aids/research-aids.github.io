    ### History of the organisation
    
    The donation of the Polyglot Bible by [Willem of Orange](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q78454) when the University of Leiden was founded in 1575 also marks the symbolic establishment of the university library. The library was officially opened in 1587 and was located in what is now Leiden University's academy building on Rapenburg. Since the publication of the first library catalogue, the Nomenclator, in 1595, the collection has grown to include many millions of books, manuscripts and other types of documents. Since 2009, the various libraries that had been established at Leiden University over the years have been merged under the name Leiden University Libraries (UBL). The UBL consists of the general university library and the libraries for Social Sciences, Law, Mathematics & Natural Sciences and the East Asian Library.

    With regard to research into colonial histories, the UBL manages a large relevant collection, particularly after the library took over the collections of the [Koninlijk Instituut voor de Tropen](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1796182) (Royal Tropical Institute) and the [Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies](https://app.colonialcollections.nl/en/research-aids/https%3A%2F%2Fn2t%252Enet%2Fark%3A%2F27023%2F62191a1bbed9b315db786f2037417b4f) (KITLV) in 2013 and 2014 respectively. The library of the [Netherlands Institute for the Near East](https://www.nino-leiden.nl/) was also incorporated into the UBL in 2018.

    In addition to its collection of written sources, the UBL also manages a large number of [Special collections](https://www.bibliotheek.universiteitleiden.nl/bijzondere-collecties), some of which are also [digitally available](https://digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl/). The [subject guides](https://www.bibliotheek.universiteitleiden.nl/subject-guides) provide more information about the wide range of available sources and where to find them. In addition to conventional books, the collection also contains tens of thousands of manuscripts, maps, cuneiform tablets and miniatures.
    
    ### Research
    
    The UBL's [digital catalogue](https://www.bibliotheek.universiteitleiden.nl/) can be consulted online and contains books, periodicals and other types of material. To facilitate your search, various [subject guides](https://www.bibliotheek.universiteitleiden.nl/subject-guides) are available. The digitised special collections can also be [consulted online](https://digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl/). In addition to its extensive collection, the UBL also manages a large amount of archive material, both from Leiden University itself and from personal and other archives. The various archive collections are described in detail in so-called [collection guides](https://collectionguides.universiteitleiden.nl/). These contain extensive information about the available material.
