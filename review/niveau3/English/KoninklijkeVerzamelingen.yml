    ### History
    
    The Koninklijke Verzamelingen (Royal Collections) consist of objects and archives collected over the centuries by members of the Nassau and Oranje-Nassau families and those close to them. These are private possessions that have been placed in the care of several foundations. The Collections form part of the Koninklijk Huisarchief (Royal House Archives). These archives have existed in its current form since 1898 and were established by Regent Emma, who brought together the family archives, the library collection and the other collections of the Van Oranje-Nassau family. To this end, Emma had a new building constructed near Noordeinde Palace in The Hague.

    When the Royal Archives were built, space was also made for a [family museum](https://www.koninklijkeverzamelingen.nl/verhalen/het-koninklijk-huisarchief), where part of the Royal Collections are still on display. The Koninklijke Verzamelingen are a fairly mobile collection: a large part of the objects have been made available to museums on long-term loan or form part of the interior decoration of the various palaces of the royal family. A good example of this is the [Indische Zaal](https://www.koninklijkeverzamelingen.nl/verhalen/de-indische-zaal) in Noordeinde Palace, where various objects from Indonesia are on display. 

    The objects in the Koninklijke Verzamelingen that originate from a colonial context are often items that were offered as gifts to the Dutch royal family. These include objects that were given to the then Dutch monarch in honour of a coronation, or objects that the royal family received during state visits. In addition to a collection of objects, the Koninklijke Verzamelingen also contains many [photographs](https://www.koninklijkeverzamelingen.nl/collectie?collecties=fotografie) from former Dutch colonies.
