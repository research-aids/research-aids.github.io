## Abstract

The Koninklijke Verzamelingen (Royal Collections) are privately owned by the Dutch royal family and are part of the Koninklijk Huisarchief (Royal House Archives). They contain a large number of objects from former Dutch colonies, many of which ended up in the collection as gifts.

### History

The Koninklijke Verzamelingen (Royal Collections) consist of objects and archives collected over the centuries by members of the Nassau and Oranje-Nassau families and those close to them. These are private possessions that have been placed in the care of several foundations. The Royal Collections form part of the Koninklijk Huisarchief (Royal House Archives). These archives have existed in their current form since 1898 and were established by Regent Emma, who brought together the family archives, the library collection and the other collections of the Oranje-Nassau family. Emma had a new building constructed near Noordeinde Palace in The Hague for this purpose.

When the Royal Archives were built, space was also made for a [family museum](https://www.koninklijkeverzamelingen.nl/verhalen/het-koninklijk-huisarchief), where part of the Royal Collections is still on display. The Koninklijke Verzamelingen are fairly mobile and many of the objects have been given to museums on long-term loan or form part of the interior decoration of the royal family’s various palaces. A good example of this is the [Indische Zaal](https://www.koninklijkeverzamelingen.nl/verhalen/de-indische-zaal) in Noordeinde Palace, where various objects from Indonesia are on display.

Many of the objects in the Koninklijke Verzamelingen that originate from a colonial context were offered to the Dutch royal family as gifts. They include objects that were gifted to the Dutch monarch of the day in honour of a coronation, or objects presented to the royal family during state visits. In addition to objects, the Koninklijke Verzamelingen also contain many [photographs](https://www.koninklijkeverzamelingen.nl/collectie?collecties=fotografie) from former Dutch colonies.
