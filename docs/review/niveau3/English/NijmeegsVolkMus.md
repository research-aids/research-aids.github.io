## Abstract

The Nijmegen Volkenkundig Museum (Nijmegen Ethnographic Museum) is a former museum that was founded in 1979 as part of the Catholic University of Nijmegen ( today Radboud University). The museum managed a large collection, much of which consisted of loans. After the museum closed in 2005, part of the collection was returned to the lenders, while other parts were relocated or sold.

### History of the museum

The Nijmegen Ethnographic Museum is a former ethnographic museum that was part of Radboud University in Nijmegen. The museum was founded in 1979 by the anthropology department. Exhibitions were held for the general public, but the collection was also used to support education. The collection consisted of around 11,000 objects, a large part of which were on loan. For example, the museum managed the collections of various congregations and also the so-called 'Beijens Collection', which former KNIL soldier [Jean Bijens](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Beijens) had donated to the municipality of Nijmegen in 1912.

In 2005, it was decided to close the Nijmegen Ethnographic Museum. A large part of the collection remained accessible afterwards in the Radboud University depot. The Beijens Collection was transferred to [Museum Bronbeek](https://app.colonialcollections.nl/en/research-guide/ https%3A%2F%2Fn2t%252Enet%2Fark%3A%2F27023%2F3443ee68039071c8125b16cf2f813f6f). The Capuchin Fathers' collection of objects was given on long-term loan to Ghent University in 2011. In 2018, the depot was closed and the [remaining items were sold](https://www.voxweb.nl/nieuws/te-koop-ethiopische-christenen-en-andere-museumrestjes).

### Provenance research

The archives of the Nijmegen Ethnographic Museum are managed by the Radboud University in Nijmegen and contain relatively little material. Inventory number 'Cb05572/56' is particularly relevant, as it contains various exhibition catalogues and a handwritten inventory of the museum collection. Inventory number 'cb05572/57' contains photographic material relating to the various exhibitions held at the Nijmegen Ethnographic Museum.

The Radboud University archive is not open to the public, but it can be accessed by submitting a motivated request to the archivist [Marianne Waldekker](mailto:marianne.waldekker@ru.nl).

The Beijens Collection, which was transferred to Museum Bronbeek in Arnhem in 2010, can be viewed on the museum's [collection website](https://museumbronbeek.nl/#1d411b24-7856-4453-af86-9b33c9c40fa7). More information about the ethnographic collection of Ghent University can be found on the website of the [Ghent University Museum](https://www.gum.gent/nl/deelcollectie-etnografie).
